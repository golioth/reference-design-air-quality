This repository contains the firmware source code and [pre-built release
firmware
images](https://github.com/golioth/reference-design-air-quality/releases)
for the Golioth Air Quality Monitor reference design.

The full project details are available on the [Air Quality Monitor
Project
Page](https://projects.golioth.io/reference-designs/air-quality-monitor),
including follow-along guides for building an IoT Air Quality Monitor
yourself using widely available off-the-shelf development boards.

We call this **Follow-Along Hardware**, and we think it's one of the
quickest and easiest ways to get started building an IoT
proof-of-concept with Golioth. In the follow-along guides, you will
learn how to assemble the hardware, flash a pre-built firmware image
onto the device, and connect to the Golioth cloud in minutes.

Once you have completed a follow-along guide for one of our supported
hardware platforms, the instructions below will walk you through how to
build and configure the firmware yourself.

# Supported Hardware

This firmware can be built for a variety of supported hardware
platforms.

> In Zephyr, each of these different hardware variants is given a unique
> "board" identifier, which is used by the build system to generate
> firmware for that variant.
>
> When building firmware using the instructions below, make sure to use
> the correct Zephyr board identifier that corresponds to your
> follow-along hardware platform.

**Custom Golioth Hardware**

# Firmware Overview

This reference design firmware demonstrates how to measure ambient air
quality within an indoor environment using the Golioth IoT platform.

Specifically, the following environmental parameters can be monitored:

  - 🦠 Airborne particulate matter (μg/m³ and \#/cm³)
  - 😷 CO₂ (ppm)
  - 💦 Relative humidity (%RH)
  - 🌡️ Temperature (°C)
  - 💨 Pressure (kPa)

# Local set up

> Do not clone this repo using git. Zephyr's `west` meta tool should be
> used to set up your local workspace.

## Install the Python virtual environment (recommended)

``` shell
cd ~
mkdir golioth-reference-design-air-quality
python -m venv golioth-reference-design-air-quality/.venv
source golioth-reference-design-air-quality/.venv/bin/activate
pip install wheel west
```

## Use `west` to initialize and install

``` shell
cd ~/golioth-reference-design-air-quality
west init -m git@github.com:golioth/reference-design-air-quality.git .
west update
west zephyr-export
pip install -r deps/zephyr/scripts/requirements.txt
```

# Building the application

Build the Zephyr sample application for the [Nordic nRF9160
DK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nrf9160-dk)
(`nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns`) from the top level of your project. After a
successful build you will see a new `build` directory. Note that any
changes (and git commits) to the project itself will be inside the `app`
folder. The `build` and `deps` directories being one level higher
prevents the repo from cataloging all of the changes to the dependencies
and the build (so no `.gitignore` is needed).

Prior to building, update `VERSION` file to reflect the firmware version
number you want to assign to this build. Then run the following commands
to build and program the firmware onto the device.

> You must perform a pristine build (use `-p` or remove the `build`
> directory) after changing the firmware version number in the `VERSION`
> file for the change to take effect.

``` text
$ (.venv) west build -p -b nrf9160dk/nrf9160/ns --sysbuild app
$ (.venv) west flash
```

Configure PSK-ID and PSK using the device shell based on your Golioth
credentials and reboot:

``` text
uart:~$ settings set golioth/psk-id <my-psk-id@my-project>
uart:~$ settings set golioth/psk <my-psk>
uart:~$ kernel reboot cold
```

# Add Pipeline to Golioth

Golioth uses [Pipelines](https://docs.golioth.io/data-routing) to route
stream data. This gives you flexibility to change your data routing
without requiring updated device firmware.

Whenever sending stream data, you must enable a pipeline in your Golioth
project to configure how that data is handled. Add the contents of
`pipelines/json-to-lightdb.yml` as a new pipeline as follows (note that
this is the default pipeline for new projects and may already be
present):

> 1.  Navigate to your project on the Golioth web console.
> 2.  Select `Pipelines` from the left sidebar and click the `Create`
>     button.
> 3.  Give your new pipeline a name and paste the pipeline configuration
>     into the editor.
> 4.  Click the toggle in the bottom right to enable the pipeline and
>     then click `Create`.

All data streamed to Golioth in JSON format will now be routed to
LightDB Stream and may be viewed using the web console. You may change
this behavior at any time without updating firmware simply by editing
this pipeline entry.

# Golioth Features

This app implements:

  - [Device Settings
    Service](https://docs.golioth.io/firmware/zephyr-device-sdk/device-settings-service)
  - [LightDB State
    Client](https://docs.golioth.io/firmware/zephyr-device-sdk/light-db/)
  - [LightDB Stream
    Client](https://docs.golioth.io/firmware/zephyr-device-sdk/light-db-stream/)
  - [Logging
    Client](https://docs.golioth.io/firmware/zephyr-device-sdk/logging/)
  - [Over-the-Air (OTA) Firmware
    Upgrade](https://docs.golioth.io/firmware/device-sdk/firmware-upgrade)
  - [Remote Procedure Call
    (RPC)](https://docs.golioth.io/firmware/zephyr-device-sdk/remote-procedure-call)

## Settings Service

The following settings can be set in the Device Settings menu of the
[Golioth Console](https://console.golioth.io).

  - `LOOP_DELAY_S`
    Adjusts the delay between sensor readings. Set to an integer value
    (seconds).

    Default value is `60` seconds.

  - `CO2_SENSOR_TEMPERATURE_OFFSET`
    Adjusts the temperature offset setting for the SCD4x CO₂ sensor. Set
    to an integer value (milli °C).

    Default value is `0` m°C.

  - `CO2_SENSOR_ALTITUDE`
    Adjusts the altitude setting for the SCD4x CO₂ sensor. Set to an
    integer value(meters above sea level).

    Default value is `0` meters.

  - `CO2_SENSOR_ASC_ENABLE`
    Enables or disables the automatic self-calibration setting for the
    SCD4x CO₂ sensor. Set to a boolean value.

    Default value is `true`.

  - `PM_SENSOR_SAMPLES_PER_MEASUREMENT`
    Adjusts the number of samples averaged together when fetching a
    measurement from the particulate matter sensor. Set to an integer
    value (samples).

    Note that each sample requires \~1s to fetch, so there is a tradeoff
    between getting a good average sample and the time required to fetch
    the measurement.

    Default value is `30` samples per measurement.

  - `PM_SENSOR_AUTO_CLEANING_INTERVAL`
    Adjusts the automatic fan cleaning interval setting for the SPS30
    particulate matter sensor. Set to an integer value (seconds).

    Default value is `604800` seconds (168 hours or 1 week).

## LightDB Stream Service

Sensor data is periodically sent to the following `sensor/*` endpoints
of the LightDB Stream service:

  - `sensor/tem`: Temperature (°C)
  - `sensor/pre`: Pressure (kPa)
  - `sensor/hum`: Humidity (%RH)
  - `sensor/co2`: CO₂ (ppm)
  - `sensor/mc_1p0`: Particulate Matter Mass Concentration 1.0 (μg/m³)
  - `sensor/mc_2p5`: Particulate Matter Mass Concentration 2.5 (μg/m³)
  - `sensor/mc_4p0`: Particulate Matter Mass Concentration 4.0 (μg/m³)
  - `sensor/mc_10p0`: Particulate Matter Mass Concentration 10.0 (μg/m³)
  - `sensor/nc_0p5`: Particulate Matter Number Concentration 0.5
    (\#/cm³)
  - `sensor/nc_1p0`: Particulate Matter Number Concentration 1.0
    (\#/cm³)
  - `sensor/nc_2p5`: Particulate Matter Number Concentration 2.5
    (\#/cm³)
  - `sensor/nc_4p0`: Particulate Matter Number Concentration 4.0
    (\#/cm³)
  - `sensor/nc_10p0`: Particulate Matter Number Concentration 10.0
    (\#/cm³)
  - `sensor/tps`: Typical Particle Size (μm)

On hardware platforms with support for battery monitoring, battery
voltage and level readings are periodically sent to the following
`battery/*` endpoints:

  - `battery/batt_v`: Battery Voltage (V)
  - `battery/batt_lvl`: Battery Level (%)

## LightDB State Service

The concept of Digital Twin is demonstrated with the LightDB State
`example_int0` and `example_int1` variables that are members of the
`desired` and `state` endpoints.

  - `desired` values may be changed from the cloud side. The device will
    recognize these, validate them for \[0..65535\] bounding, and then
    reset these endpoints to `-1`
  - `state` values will be updated by the device whenever a valid value
    is received from the `desired` endpoints. The cloud may read the
    `state` endpoints to determine device status, but only the device
    should ever write to the `state` endpoints.

## Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Service

The following RPCs can be initiated in the Remote Procedure Call menu of
the [Golioth Console](https://console.golioth.io).

  - `get_network_info`
    Query and return network information.

  - `reboot`
    Reboot the system.

  - `set_log_level`
    Set the log level.

    The method takes a single parameter which can be one of the
    following integer values:

      - `0`: `LOG_LEVEL_NONE`
      - `1`: `LOG_LEVEL_ERR`
      - `2`: `LOG_LEVEL_WRN`
      - `3`: `LOG_LEVEL_INF`
      - `4`: `LOG_LEVEL_DBG`

  - `clean_pm_sensor`
    Initiate the SPS30 particulate matter fan-cleaning procedure
    manually. The fan cleaning procedure takes approximately 10s to
    complete.

  - `reset_pm_sensor`
    Reset the SPS30 particulate matter sensor.

# Hardware Variations

This reference design may be built for a variety of different boards.

Prior to building, update `VERSION` file to reflect the firmware version
number you want to assign to this build. Then run the following commands
to build and program the firmware onto the device.

## Golioth Aludel Elixir

This reference design may be built for the Golioth Aludel Elixir board.
By default this will build for the latest hardware revision of this
board.

``` text
$ (.venv) west build -p -b aludel_elixir/nrf9160/ns --sysbuild app
$ (.venv) west flash
```

To build for a specific board revision (e.g. Rev A) add the revision
suffix `@<rev>`.

``` text
$ (.venv) west build -p -b aludel_elixir@A/nrf9160/ns --sysbuild app
$ (.venv) west flash
```

# OTA Firmware Update

This application includes the ability to perform Over-the-Air (OTA)
firmware updates:

1.  Update the version number in the
    <span class="title-ref">VERSION</span> file and perform a pristine
    (important) build to incorporate the version change.
2.  Upload the
    <span class="title-ref">build/app/zephyr/zephyr.signed.bin</span>
    file as an artifact for your Golioth project using
    <span class="title-ref">main</span> as the package name.
3.  Create and roll out a release based on this artifact.
